# Blobcity
My own game project about plant-blobs seeking a home.

# Current Progress:
Prototype for walking [WASD], checking homes and blobs for their information (stats), marking them individually [M] and functional matchmaking [P].
Basic UI with visible stats.

# Planned Next Steps:
Saving System between two Scenes, seperating the housing place and blob place.
Deciding on necessary UI Elements.
First Playtesting.
